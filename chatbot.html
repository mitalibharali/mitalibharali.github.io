									<h2>Conversational Chat Bot </h2>
                                </header>
								
								<p><h2>I. Introduction</h2>
                                    The growth of Natural Language Processing is exponential in today’s time and its
                                    implementation is being recognized in almost every industry. A recent study by the Kelsey
                                    Group reports that increasing numbers of companies are investing in voice or speech
                                    recognition and processing technologies at an alarming rate to save money by replacing
                                    operators and to improve service to their customers. Reading text from prints, Speech
                                    Recognition to Language Translation, and future adaptations not yet discerned. Given if we can
                                    acquire the full potential of what NLP is capable of, it can snowball into technology of its own,
                                    much like other engineering fields. In information retrieval sense, it would mean harnessing an
                                    astronomical amount of data if exploited to full capacity and hence tuning all areas of technical
                                    expertise.</p>
                                    Tapping this area meant starting with the basics from preprocessing technics to vectorizing
                                    words to apply similarity and making to basic conversation. This report illustrates these aspects
                                    of NLP to create a conversational chatbot implemented through an GUI application.
                                    <p> <h2>II. Dataset Description</h2>
                                    There are three datasets used for this project:
                                    i. Dialogue.tsv – that classifies non-technical, natural English dialogues.
                                    ii. Stackoverflow.tsv – that classifies data into programming topic related questions, each of
                                    which belong to one class of programming language.
                                    iii. Starspace.tsv – that maps to the corresponding answers to questions, used in creating
                                    word embeddings.
                                    <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/c2.png" alt="" /></a>
                                    Fig1. Dialogue.tsv Fig2. Stackoverflow.tsv Fig3. Starspace.tsv
                                    Each of these datasets has 3 millions observations, hence its recommended to use cloud
                                    interface for data retrieval and modeling. There are no missing values in any of the dataset.
                                    </p>                                    
                                    <p><h>III. Architecture</h>
                                    <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/c3.png" alt="" /></a>
                                    The code is broadly divided into two parts, one that has the utility functions Utils and the
                                    other that has the Main Bot Handler  Dialogue Manager. Utils has text_prepare function
                                    that preprocesses, td-idf_features that vectorizes and Question-to-Vec function that creates
                                    embeddings, each called as required. The Main Bot has two broad categories – Intend
                                    Recognizer that classifies the input question and, Threat Ranker that gets the best answer
                                    for the question vector.</p>
                                    <p><h2>IV. Natural Language Processing</h2>

                                    <h3>i. Preprocessing</h3>
                                    The preprocessing starts with basics of NLP. One function text_prepare is used to perform all
                                    the below preprocessing:
                                    3

                                    a) Lemmatization
                                    b) Stemming
                                    c) Stopwords removal
                                    Lemmatization normally aims to remove inflectional endings only and to return the base or
                                    dictionary form of a word, known as the lemma. While stemming often includes the removal of
                                    derivational affixes. Stopwords would remove frequently used English auxiliary words which
                                    contribute no specific meaning to the sentence, usually used for grammatical purpose – a, the,
                                    an, or, so…</p>
                                    <p><h3>ii. TF-IDF</h3>
                                    This is another form of the preprocessing making it more readable, extracting features for the
                                    machine learning algorithm to work on. Tfidf_features is made and once called; data is dumped
                                    in the pickle to later use it in the bot.</p>
                                    <p><h3>iii. Word Embeddings</h3>
                                    A word embedding is a learned representation for text where words that have the same meaning
                                    have a similar representation. The vectorized data is measured for proximity with similarity
                                    function in the vector space which translates into the similarity in the meaning of the words in
                                    textual language. This is used to train the bot to find the similarity between the question vectors
                                    (Stackoverflow data) and the existing threat- most likely answers data (Starspace data). Cosine
                                    similarity is used here. This helps in ranking model – where the most likely answer from the
                                    given programming topic searched for the input question. The evaluation matric used here is
                                    pariwise distance argmin.</p>
                                    <p><h3>V. Machine Learning</h3>
                                    There are majorly two machine learning used for training the dataset – Logistic Regression and
                                    Multiclass OnevsRest. The logistic regression is used in the Indent Recognizer section to classify
                                    the question vector into Dialogue or Technical Query. For this, a concatenated dataset of
                                    Dialogues.tsv and Stackoverflow.tsv is used. Multiclass OnevsRest is used in labelling the tags
                                    against the right query – Python tags to python-based queries and so on. A word embedding is
                                    formed from starspace.tsv data that is used as answers to the question vectors, that is used in
                                    Threat Ranker. The ideal approach to deciding the algorithm would be to start with simplest
                                    models with least parameters and extend to advance deep learning models like RNN and LSTM.
                                    While in this project, accuracy and performance of simple models were high, deep models would
                                    have overfitted the dataset and performed poorly on new dataset.
                                    </p>
                                    <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/c5.png" alt="" /></a>
                                    <p<h3>VI. Output</h3>
                                    The output of the algorithm looks as below. The main_bot function logic calls the dialogue
                                    manager function against the input data. The dialogue manager tests it for intend and once
                                    recognized as technical query, predicts the onevsrest model and uses the threat ranker to find
                                    the optimum solution.</p>
                                    <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/c6.png" alt="" /></a>
                                    <p><h3>VII. Recommendation</h3>
                                    Chat bot is right now the most widely used application of NLP, finding its implementation in
                                    customer experience improvement process. Any online website of a company can help redirect
                                    lost customer to the right section, hence reducing the TAT time, checkout time and hence
                                    increasing conversion rate. Effective chat bots can help navigate customer into right products,
                                    which could be useful in giants like Amazon, Walmart. Recommendation systems can also be
                                    
                                    greatly benefited from this. In totality, it improves customer experience and helps in long term
                                    relationship management.</p>
                                    <p><h3>VIII.Conclusion</h3>
                                    This project is a small illustration of how to implement a simple Chat Bot to a website for a
                                    customer relationship management. There are several areas of improvement here, like
                                    tokenizing with a software API, using further more data through cloud platforms like Big Query
                                    and AWS, modeling with deep learning algorithms and creating further more dialogue blocks to
                                    refine the prediction.
